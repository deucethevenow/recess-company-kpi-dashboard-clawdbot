## 🎯 MISSION
Build an executive KPI dashboard for Recess (two-sided CPG marketplace) that tracks company health metrics, individual accountability per person, and department-level drill-downs. Dashboard must match Recess brand and be professional enough for board presentations.

## 📍 CURRENT STATE
- **Phase:** MVP Complete - ready for user testing and feedback
- **Active Feature:** KPI Dashboard v1.0
- **Baseline:** HEALTHY - Streamlit server running at localhost:8501

## 🧠 KEY DECISIONS
- **Left sidebar navigation**: Frees horizontal space, feels more like an app (inspired by Donezo dashboard example)
- **Light theme**: Matches Recess.is website brand (#13bad5 cyan, #ff8900 orange)
- **Table-based team scorecard**: Better data density than cards for 17 people
- **Info icon tooltips**: Hover to see definition, importance, and calculation for each metric
- **CEO metric = Revenue vs Target**: Jack owns the North Star metric
- **COO metric = Gross Margin %**: Deuce owns operational efficiency

## 📋 TODO (Top 5, Prioritized)
- [ ] **HIGH:** Wire up BigQuery data source (replace mock data)
- [ ] **HIGH:** Add Google OAuth login via Cloud IAP
- [ ] **MED:** Query BigQuery for NPS and Offer Acceptance baselines
- [ ] **MED:** Add Engineering metrics via GitHub/Asana APIs (Phase 2)
- [ ] **LOW:** Deploy to Google Cloud Run

## 🧵 SCOPE NOTES
- Original ask: Build KPI dashboard with all department metrics
- Current scope: MVP with mock data + polished UI, BigQuery integration pending
